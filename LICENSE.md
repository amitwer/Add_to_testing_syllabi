Not a Lawyer, not going to understand every different option there is for a license here. 
Short summary of what I hope will be: 
- The content here is not mine in any way. It is a reference list to stuff found in other places. Each resource comes with a link to the source (if possible).
- The licensing of each resource is the same as determined by that specific resource.
- You can use this list in any way you want, no need for attribution.
  - If you make profit out of this list, please include next to the list a short (visible) line that points people to this git repository and mention it's freely available.
