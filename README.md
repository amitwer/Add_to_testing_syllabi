# Add_to_testing_syllabi
I'll be putting here stuff that I encounter and are good things to teach people who want to start their way in software testing. 
Feel free to add your own recommendations.

Files content: 
* [Entry level resources.md](https://github.com/amitwer/Add_to_testing_syllabi/blob/master/Entry%20level%20resources.md) Talks, blog posts, and material for beginners. Ideally, each entry there should convey an idea.
* [others.md](https://github.com/amitwer/Add_to_testing_syllabi/blob/master/others.md): Other collections created by other people. Chances are - it will be more extensive than the collection here.
* [My blog](https://always-fearful.blogspot.com/): My own personal soapbox, where I think out loud, rant and occaisionally manage to write something interesting.
